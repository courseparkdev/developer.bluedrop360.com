<h1 id="online-offering-api">Online Offering API</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Online Offering API is to allow Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development (MLTSD) approved training providers not using the SkillsPass system to list online (E-Learning) offerings in the MLTSD Marketplace.</p>
<p>Note that the API provides a listing service only for the MLTSD Marketplace. Any attempts at booking training will be redirected back to the training providerâ€™s own website, and it is up to the individual training provider to manage that booking accordingly.</p>
<p>The API currently supports only online offerings related to both Joint Health and Safety Committee Part One. This is captured in the <em>trainingStandardKey</em> attribute in the reference documentation, and the complete list of support values is included in the <em>Technical</em> section below. Training providers must always map their class offerings to one of these standard courses.</p>
<p>MLTSD-approved training providers are issued a unique identifier by MLTSD, which must be included with every request. Please refer to the <em>networkKey</em> attribute in the reference documentation.</p>
